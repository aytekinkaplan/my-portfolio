        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Aytekin Kaplan, and I am a passionate Software Development
          Engineer in Test with a robust background in both manual and automated
          testing. I have a degree in Physics from Istanbul University and a
          strong foundation in SDLC and STLC. I thrive in dynamic, fast-paced IT
          environments and enjoy working on challenging projects that push the
          boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my current role, I leverage tools such as Selenium WebDriver,
          Maven, Cucumber, JUnit, and TestNG to ensure software quality through
          rigorous testing methodologies. I am experienced in developing
          Automation Frameworks and have a keen interest in Continuous
          Integration and Delivery practices using Jenkins. I am also adept at
          API testing using Postman and have a solid understanding of SQL and
          database management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I am an active education volunteer, conducting
          workshops and mentoring students to help them achieve their academic
          goals. I am committed to continuous learning and enjoy exploring new
          technologies and testing frameworks to stay ahead in the industry.
